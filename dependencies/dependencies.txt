Autodruid 3_5 is a set of macros and API commands for use with Roll20, intended to automate the D&D 3.5e druid class's wild shape feature. It relies on the following dependencies
    1. A Roll20 Pro account
    2. The ChatSetAttr mod, available as a 1-click install from the Mod Library. 
    3. Token-Mod, also available as a 1-click install from the Mod Library. 
    4. The Delay mod, from https://app.roll20.net/forum/post/6533907/script-delay/?pagenum=1. I have included this script in the Autodruid 3_5 repository as delay.js.
    5. The OnMyTurn mod, from https://app.roll20.net/forum/permalink/6612955/. I have included this script in the Autodruid 3_5 repository as OnMyTurn.js.
