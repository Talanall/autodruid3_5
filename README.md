# autodruid3_5
autodruid3_5 is a project that automates the D&D 3.5 edition druid class's wild shape class feature. It leverages the Roll20 API to provide a push-button amenity that changes a Roll20 character's token artwork and game statistics to bring them in line with the approximately 100 animal, plant, and elemental creatures that are available in the Core Rules for 3.5e.

This project is incompatible with the currently-existing Roll20 character sheets for D&D 3.5e. Instead, it sets character attributes to be manipulated via a collection of preassembled API commands, chat menus, and roll templates.
