# autodruid3_5
autodruid3_5 is a project that automates the D&D 3.5 edition druid class's wild shape class feature. It leverages the Roll20 API to provide a push-button amenity that changes a Roll20 character's token artwork and game statistics to bring them in line with the ~100 or so animal, plant, and elemental creatures that are available in the Core Rules for 3.5e.
